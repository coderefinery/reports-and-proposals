# Information for potential CodeRefinery partners

## What is CodeRefinery?

CodeRefinery is a community-driven initiative designed to empower researchers and Research Software Engineers with the skills and tools needed to develop high-quality, efficient, and sustainable research software. By focusing on practical training in areas such as version control, testing, and reproducible workflows, we bridge the gap between research and software engineering. Our mission is to foster collaboration, improve research output, and promote open-source principles across academic disciplines.

Since its beginning in 2016, CodeRefinery has contributed to enhancing the software development capabilities of the academic community. Over the past eight years, we have developed a comprehensive, openly maintained curriculum of best practices that has been taught to nearly 3000 participants across 20 countries and countless scientific fields. With the help of around 30 instructors, organizers, and facilitators, we have conducted 9 online and 28 in-person workshops, reaching individuals at all career stages and with diverse programming expertise.

Our success lies in more than just the numbers. CodeRefinery has cultivated a vibrant, collaborative community of instructors, learners, helpers, and partner organizations. Together, we’ve built a robust training network and a foundation for long-term improvements in research software development.

However, the need for teaching researchers how to build software that is reusable and reproducible is ongoing. As the demand for cutting-edge digital skill development grows, so does the importance of updating and expanding our world-class curriculum. To sustain and build upon the momentum we've created, continued contributions from skilled instructors and coordinated efforts are crucial.

We are reaching out to organizations that value training and digital skill development as part of their mission. With your support, we can ensure that CodeRefinery continues to enhance the capabilities of researchers and software engineers, ultimately advancing the quality and reproducibility of academic research.

## What are the benefits of becoming a partner? 

Benefits for Partnering Organizations

- **Continuous Access to High-Demand Training**
    By supporting the continuation of CodeRefinery, partners ensure the availability of high-quality workshops that address the growing need for research software development skills. These workshops empower researchers and enhance organizational capacity in digital and computational skills.

- **Strategic Input on Curriculum Development**
    Partners have the opportunity to shape the evolution of present and new course materials, providing an opportunity that training aligns with the specific needs of their researchers and institutional priorities.

- **Participation in Collaborative Training Initiatives**
    Partnering organizations gain early access and priority in event scheduling to collaborative training events, including train-the-trainer programs, which help build internal capacity for delivering impactful training programs.

- **Increased Visibility and Networking Opportunities**
    Workshops and events co-hosted with CodeRefinery are promoted to an extensive network of academic institutions, researchers, and trainers, offering partners visibility and opportunities for collaboration on a European to even global scale.

- **Representation in the Steering Committee**
    Partner organizations receive a seat in the CodeRefinery Steering Committee, providing them with a direct role in governance and strategic decision-making, ensuring their voice is heard in shaping the future of the project.

- **Recognition and Public Acknowledgment**
    Contributing partners are acknowledged in every workshop they support and prominently highlighted on CodeRefinery’s website and social media channels, showcasing their commitment to advancing research software development.


## What does becoming a partner actually mean?

We invite interested organizations to join us in sustaining CodeRefinery by contributing staff time to support our work. This commitment does not require a new or additional allocation of resources; rather, it should align with your existing teaching and training activities. The key difference is a collaborative approach — working together to deliver impactful training.

We recommend an in-kind contribution of 1–2 working days per week per person, ideally involving more than one staff member from your organization. Contributions like these will help ensure the continuity and growth of CodeRefinery as a vibrant and open collaboration network.

**Proposed Model for Collaboration**

CodeRefinery will continue as a decentralized network with the following structure:

- **In-Kind Contributions**
    Partners provide staff time funded by their own organizations to support training and workshop activities.
- **Workshops** 
    CodeRefinery will maintain its popular workshops at minimum once a year.
- **Specialized Training** 
    In addition to core workshops, we encourage partners to collaborate on specialized sessions (e.g., data visualization, containerization, reproducible workflows, data management).
- **Autonomy with Shared Responsibility** 
    Partner organizations retain full administrative control over their staff but are expected to allocate time for collaborative efforts that benefit the broader CodeRefinery network.
- **Outreach and Engagement**
    Partners are responsible for promoting CodeRefinery workshops to their local and institutional audiences to maximize participation and impact.

By becoming a partner, your organization actively contributes to advancing research software development, fosters a culture of collaboration, and plays a vital role in shaping the future of open, high-quality training for researchers and research software engineers.
