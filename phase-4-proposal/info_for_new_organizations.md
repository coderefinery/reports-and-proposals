# Information for potential CodeRefinery partners

## What is CodeRefinery

CodeRefinery as a project has existed since 2016, under various funding models. In this period, we have trained over XX students, 
researchers, and infrastructure staff to advance FAIRness of software management and development practices, 
in over XX workshops. 
We have collaboratively built up a solid curriculum and have managed to build a community and a training network for teaching together. 

The need for teaching researchers to develop software that contributes to reproducible and reusable research 
as well as the need to update and develop world-class curriculum does not stop at the end of the CodeRefinery project. 
To keep this momentum, contribution by both skilled and motivated CodeRefinery instructors and coordination effort are essential. 
Therefore we are approaching the organizations that have training and digital skill development as a part of their mandates within and outside the Nordics.

## What are the benefits of becoming a partner? 

Benefits for participating organizations (depending on the level of commitment):
    • Continuation of CodeRefinery into the future and thus access to more workshops which are in high demand.
    • Influence on course material development.
    • Participation in collaborative training and train-the-trainer events.
    • Cross-advertisement of workshops to a wide network of trainers and learners.
    • Partners are acknowledged in every workshop they contribute to and highlighted on our website and social media.

## What does becoming a partner actually mean?

We kindly ask interested organizations to indicate with a letter of intent on how many person months 
or what FTE share you plan to contribute to this project per year to support our application towards the 
NeIC funding. We don't expect this to be some new commitment: the actual time should overlap with your existing teaching time, 
the only difference is a commitment to teach together. 
We recommend an in-kind contribution of 1 or 2 working days per week, ideally for more than one person per organization.
Further below we will also highlight the benefits for participating organizations.

In our proposed mode, CodeRefinery continues to exist as an open collaboration network with the following model:
    • Partners provide staff working hours with own funding. 
    • CodeRefinery continues to give its 3 day workshops split over 6 half-days
    • In addition, we hope that partners begin collaborating on more specialized workshops 
    (e.g. data visualization, containerization, reproducible workflows, data management, etc.).
    • Staff are under full administrative control of the partner, but there is an expectation 
    that at least some time goes to the greater benefits of our collaboration. 
    No one can be forced to do anything that is not beneficial to their organization.
    • Partners have a responsibility for advertising to their own audiences to attend workshops.
