To whom it may concern:

INSTITUTION_OR_TEAM_NAME is pleased to see the continuation of the CodeRefinery project, and is happy to continue as a member of the collaboration.
Our contribution to CodeRefinery will be administered by the TEAM NAME. 
NAME supports DESCRIPTION, and we have certainly noticed the importance of practical computing skills taught at an accessible level for researchers to do science.

==== PICK WHAT PARAGRAPHS ARE RELEVANT =====

The CodeRefinery phase 4 plan aligns with our plans for the future, and NAME will contribute approximately like we have been in the past. 
We do not explicitly divide staff between teaching and other responsibilities, 
but on average we expect to contribute about XX FTE/year in teaching which could be shared among a general CodeRefinery audience.

We have not yet been active in CodeRefinery, but we see the value in this.  
We would like to be involved in CodeRefinery stage 4 as part of the expansion.  
We don't yet know what teaching staff we can provide, but we would like to contribute some co-instructors, 
and will work to advertise CodeRefinery workshops to our community while building our participation.

Examples of past courses at our institution relevant to CodeRefinery include NAMES.

=====

In addition to direct contributions, we will actively support the project by advertising its workshops and materials.
We will also enable our specialists to travel as needed to further the projectâ€™s objectives.

We see a good value in NeIC support, because it will ensure that shared teaching can continue, 
greatly increasing our impact and our benefit from outside courses.

Best regards,
