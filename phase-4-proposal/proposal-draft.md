# **DRAFT** Proposal to the NeIC Strategic Committee to support phase 4 of CodeRefinery (2025 \- 2028\)


## Summary of what we are asking for

(this will be written after we know the rest)


## Background

CodeRefinery is a **community-driven initiative designed to empower students,
researchers, staff, and research software engineers** with the skills and tools
needed to develop high-quality, efficient, reusable, and reproducible research
software. By focusing on practical training in areas such as version control,
documentation, testing, sharing, and reproducible workflows, we bridge the gap
between research and software engineering. Our mission is to foster
collaboration, improve research output, and promote open-source principles
across academic disciplines. Open science is an important goal for universities
and research institutions, and CodeRefinery is a key component in working
towards this goal.

Since its beginning in 2016, CodeRefinery has contributed to enhancing the
software development capabilities of the academic community in the Nordics and
beyond. Over the past eight years, we have developed a comprehensive, openly
maintained curriculum of lessons and courses that has been taught at over 40
workshops. **We reach ca. 500 learners each year at all career stages and
across all disciplines** and with a diverse range of programming expertise. We
achieve this with the help of around 30 instructors, organizers, and
facilitators.

CodeRefinery has cultivated a vibrant, collaborative community of instructors,
learners, helpers, and partner organizations. Together, **we have built a
robust cross-border training network** and a foundation for long-term
improvements in research software development.

The need to train the academic community in software development skills has not
decreased over the course of the last eight years. On the contrary, we see a
growing demand and **we anticipate that this demand will continue to increase
significantly** with the ongoing digital transformation of research and the
omnipresence of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI).
Researchers will need even more training on how to deploy, maintain, and share
ML and AI models, how to transfer them from their laptops to high-performance
computing (HPC) environments and AI factories, and how to make them
reproducible and reusable for the broader research community.

Proposals need to offer not only a foundation and stability but also
innovation. The innovation that we offer is to constantly **innovate how we
teach**. Our material and our methods are constantly updated and improved. We
have developed innovative teaching methods to reach more learners and to be
able to on-board more instructors. Our innovative teaching methods offer a
learning path not only for learners but also for instructors. Our approach to
training has inspired other training networks to follow our methods and to join
us and teach together.

With this proposal, we are reaching out to NeIC and its partner organizations.
These organizations value training and digital skill development as part of
their mission. With the support of our project partners, we can ensure that
CodeRefinery continues to enhance the capabilities of researchers and software
engineers, ultimately advancing the quality and reproducibility of academic
research. We want to offer a quality of training in the spirit of a **training
cooperative** with our partners that would not be possible for any of the
project partners alone. We all need to provide training in digital skills, but
we can do it better together.


## Teaching solid foundations in the age of artificial intelligence

Since 2022, the field of artificial intelligence and large-language models have
transformed education, research, and the funding landscape. So-called AI
Factories which are set to provide an ecosystem for AI research by combining
compute capabilities, data, and support, are being established in many
countries and are attracting significant funding and attention.

Our expectation is that these new technologies might open the door to
computing, programming, and data science to new research groups and academic
disciplines, previously under-represented in high-performance computing.

We expect that both the users of these resources as well as staff supporting
them will need solid training in how to install and deploy software written by
others and how to develop and maintain software themselves and make it usable
by others. We expect that we will be an important partner to set this training
up. For this, we will also need to expand our curriculum with lessons about how
to version and share data and models, in addition to the existing material on
how to version and share code and dependencies.


## CodeRefinery and research data management

FAIR data practices and research data management (RDM) are relatively well
established across the Nordics. To those who focus on the software side of open
science in their work and teaching, it can feel like RDM is a decade ahead in
terms of maturity, acceptance, and the number of reach of good existing
networks.

However, in practice, data and software are connected: Data is often produced,
analyzed, and visualized by software. It makes sense to at least know about
good software practices when teaching RDM, and vice versa.

In this project we wish to help closing the gap between training in RDM and
research software engineering (RSE). It will require that we adapt our material
to be useful to RDM support staff. Their focus is data but their learners and
contacts ask questions about both software and data. We can help them helping
their users by providing training in FAIR research software development
practices adapted to a learner persona that is possibly not writing software
but helps researchers who do.  Here it will be about the hands-on practice and
more about the basics and awareness of tools and techniques to send the
researchers towards the right direction (e.g. to RSEs). It will be very
beneficial that the CodeRefinery network is well connected to RSEs in the
Nordics.  Such new material could also be useful to give group leaders and
managers an overview of modern tools and practices for FAIR software
development.

## Benefits for partner organizations

**Continuous access to training:** These workshops empower researchers and
enhance organizational capacity in digital and computational skills. By being a
partner, organizations can influence scheduling and make sure that the training
is visible to their students, researchers, and staff.

**Strategic input on curriculum development:** Partners have the opportunity to
shape the evolution of present and new course materials, providing an
opportunity that training aligns with the specific needs of their researchers
and institutional priorities.

**Participation in collaborative training initiatives:** Partnering
organizations gain early access and priority in event scheduling to
collaborative training events, including train-the-trainer programs, which help
build internal capacity for delivering impactful training programs.

**Increased visibility and networking opportunities:** Workshops and events
co-hosted with CodeRefinery are promoted to an extensive network of academic
institutions, researchers, and trainers, offering partners visibility and
opportunities for collaboration on a European to even global scale.

**Representation in the steering committee:** Partner organizations receive a
seat in the CodeRefinery Steering Committee, providing them with a direct role
in governance and strategic decision-making, ensuring their voice is heard in
shaping the future of the project.

**Recognition and public acknowledgment:** Contributing partners are
acknowledged in every workshop they support and prominently highlighted on
CodeRefinery’s website and social media channels, showcasing their commitment
to advancing research software development.


## Collaboration model

CodeRefinery will continue as a decentralized network with the following
structure:

**In-kind contributions:** Partners provide staff time funded by their own
organizations to support training and workshop activities.  Partner
organizations retain full administrative control over their staff but are
expected to allocate time for collaborative efforts that benefit the broader
CodeRefinery network. The concept is to allocate staff time to work on training
efforts that the organization would like to do anyway but collaboratively with
other partners and in a broader context.

**Workshops:** CodeRefinery will maintain its popular workshops at minimum once
a year.

**Specialized training:** In addition to core workshops, we encourage partners
to collaborate on specialized sessions (e.g. data visualization,
containerization, reproducible workflows, data management).

**Outreach and engagement:** Partners help the project to promote CodeRefinery
workshops to their local and institutional audiences. We see this as a win-win
situation so that both the partner organization and CodeRefinery benefits from
having better visibility and reach.


## Governance and sustainability plan

NeIC will administrate the collaboration and appoint a steering committee chair
and project manager. Collaboration partners will sign a collaboration agreement
with NeIC (for reference,
[here](https://coderefinery.org/about/reports/phase-3-collaboration-agreement.pdf)
is the collaboration agreement from phase 3 of the project).

In addition to this document we have drafted a [governance
charter](https://github.com/coderefinery/governance-charter) for the project
which we expect to be approved in February 2025, before the start of phase 4\.
The latter document outlines the decision process and the community-facing
aspect of the collaboration. The charter also defines what the project actually
contains in terms of lessons, data, communication channels, and accounts and
clarifies responsibilities and ownership.

With the in-kind model we hope to make it easier for new organizations to join
the project, also possibly only for an event or only short-term. This will
require us to communicate the value and benefits. Going forward, we will
however also seek national and European funding and the governance charter
gives the steering committee the possibility to form a consortium applying for
external funding on behalf of the CodeRefinery collaboration.
