## Building a training network for research software skill empowerment through CodeRefinery 
CodeRefinery (https://coderefinery.org/) is a project funded by Nordic e-infrastructure collaboration and 7 partners (Aalto university, CSC - IT Center for Science, Center for Humanities Computing, Danish e-Infrastructure Consortium, EuroCC National Competence Center Sweden (ENCCS) , National Academic Infrastructure for SuperÂ­computing in Sweden (NAISS),  NRIS/Sigma2) supporting students and researchers across all research fields by teaching FAIR (Findable, Acessible, Interoperable, Reusable) research software development and basic Research Software Engineering practices. The project is currently stepping to the fourth phase of funding with eight years of fulfilment and the team is working on making the project sustainable in the future. 
The CodeRefinery project provides open, reusable and self-learning ready lesson materials developed by experts from different countries, organizations and scientific backgrounds. CodeRefinery focuses on maintaining collaboration in lesson development, teaching and workshop organization. Workshops with multiple roles especially highlight the value of collaborative efforts. The initiative has successfully held interactive hands-on online and free workshops based on these materials on computational Science topics for over 300 registrants at a time (see https://coderefinery.org/workshops/past/). The bi-annual workshops themselves nowadays combine livestream, co-teaching, parallelized and threaded questions and answers as well as parallel connected in-person events. With the new way of delivering workshops, it was possible to scale beyond one classroom while still keeping the workshops hands-on and interactive. Leaving the traditional online teaching strategy and creating our own vision of how online teaching could be required adjusting to alternative technologies and mindset.
Over the years we have had Scientists from all levels join the workshops: from undergraduate, graduate, post-doc to professors from all domains. Particularly well liked topics of the workshops are the introduction to collaborative distributed version control, software documentation and modular code development. The materials and workshops of the project will help the High Performance Computing (HPC) and scientific computing community to grow a next generation of Research Software Engineers and researchers with sufficient knowledge in FAIR software development practices to be part of a sustainable research software ecosystem.

Finally, CodeRefinery is not just workshops, it also is a community of people that enjoy helping others write better code and use computing resources efficiently. It has different programs to build a community to empower people write reproducible and sustainable research code no matter their domain or career stage or where they are from. 
The CodeRefinery "Bring Your Own Classroom" initiative allows local partners to host satellite events to the CodeRefinery workshops in their own spaces, either virtually or in-person. This approach helps scale the workshop experience while maintaining a sense of community. 
The ambassador program is designed for individuals who are passionate about CodeRefinery's mission and want to help spread the word within their communities. Ambassadors receive support from CodeRefinery, including materials for presentations, posters, and training sessions, as well as goodies to distribute at events. With frequent newsletters, blogposts and a very active Zulip chat, community engagement is assured.

The goal of the fourth phase of the project is to go beyond the reach of our current advertising (mainly Nordics and central Europe) for the workshops and materials we develop and build a diverse and inclusive global community with FAIR research software skills.
