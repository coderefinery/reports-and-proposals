# Lesson material development using the CodeRefinery lesson template

CodeRefinery is a project funded by Nordic e-infrastructure collaboration (NeiC) 
supporting students and researchers across all research fields by teaching FAIR research software and development
and basic Research Software Engineering practices.

For our workshops lesson materials we have developed our own lesson template to cater to the needs of a workshop serving many different audiences.

The lesson material is written as Markdown files and built with the static site generator Sphinx; a GitHub action automates the building of the materials and making it available via GitHub Pages. 

Many of the steps involved in building the materials, we also teach in our workshops as part of our [Documentation lesson](https://coderefinery.github.io/documentation/) which is also an example of how the lesson materials can look.

This contribution will describe the process of creating nice looking learning materials using the CodeRefinery lesson template. Including the implementations of information boxes, toggled solutions, tabs and code highlighting.
