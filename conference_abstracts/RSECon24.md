# Bring your own classroom to a CodeRefinery workshop

CodeRefinery is a project funded by Nordic e-infrastructure collaboration (NeiC) 
supporting students and researchers across all research fields by teaching FAIR research software and development
and basic Research Software Engineering practices.

Our workshops are streamed so that anyone (awake at the time) can follow them. Registered participants have the possibility to interact with the instructors on stream via a collaborative document. The open source reusable materials (available at https://coderefinery.org/lessons/core/) include lectures as well as hands-on activities.

For the hands-on activities, one effective way to learn is by learning together. The way we facilitate this in a streamed workshop is via local partners. The local partner provides an online or in-person room with a team-lead. Everyone watches the stream together and at exercise time, the stream pauses and exercises can be discussed in the group under guidance of the team lead. This way, the local organizations do not have to provide their own full course, but can join our workshops with relatively low effort.

This contribution will motivate and describe the workshop setup for scaling an interactive workshop to a few hundred participants while still keeping the interaction and community experience of a local small workshop. It will show some advantages and challenges, and how those can be addressed, as well as how YOU can join our next workshop.
