# Bring your own classroom to a CodeRefinery workshop

CodeRefinery is a project teaching FAIR research software and development 
and basic Research Software Engineering practices to students and researchers across all research fields. CodeRefinery is funded by Nordic e-infrastructure collaboration (NeiC).

- collaborative project between universities and organizations in the Nordics

Our workshops are streamed and recorded so that anyone can follow them. Registered participants have the possibility to interact with the instructors on stream via a collaborative document. The open source materials (available at https://coderefinery.org/lessons/core/) include lectures as well as hands-on activities. Sharing reusable training materials is one of the projects core values.

CodeRefinery works with local partners to facilitate an interactive and collaborative workshop despite the challenges of large audiences and online teaching. The local partner provides an online or in-person room with a team-lead. The local participants watch the stream together and during exercise time, the stream pauses and exercises can be discussed in the group under guidance of the team lead.

- This approach enables local organizations to provide participants with a full workshop while maintaining the benefits of discussing and working together as a group.
- The local participants can discuss and work together under the guidance of the team lead during the workshop exercises
- This way, the local organizations do not have to provide their own full course, but can join our workshops with relatively low effort.

This contribution will describe a workshop setup for scaling an interactive workshop to a few hundred participants while still keeping the interaction and community experience of a local small workshop. We would also like to invite YOU to join our next workshop as a learner, team-lead or local partner.
